# Ionic Coding Challenge

#### Adjustments
Figma Mockup's Header Image Blend Mode
```
background: #5A7EFD;
mix-blend-mode: soft-light;
```
My adjustment
```
background: #5A7EFD;
mix-blend-mode: overlay; // <-- adjustment
```
For some reason, setting `mix-blend-mode: soft-light` during development gave the image a very different tone than the mockup's depiction.\
So I made a little adjustment and found that `mix-blend-mode: overlay` brought the image closer to the mockup's example.
